# Bronze Is the Battlefield: Why Real Data Engineers Start at the Source

Don’t just query downstream tables. Capture events, own lineage, and forge the Bronze layer where data engineering truly begins.

Bronze is the raw layer where events first land: offsets, schemas, timestamps, payloads, nothing cleaned and nothing lost.

---

## The Trap of SQL Modeling

Many junior data engineers start with SQL: query tables, shape views, and model downstream data. This is useful, but if you stay there you inherit upstream flaws: missing lineage, late data, brittle reprocessing. That is building on sand.

What this looks like in practice:

- You optimize queries on data you did not ingest, so you cannot explain gaps, duplicates, or odd timestamps.
- You deduplicate by heuristics instead of by offsets and event time, so results drift as volumes grow.
- You backfill with ad hoc SQL because the original offsets and checkpoints are unknown.
- You cannot answer basic questions about provenance: where did this record come from, and what was its schema at ingestion time.

Why this hurts teams:

- Debugging slows to a crawl because no one owns the first mile of data.
- Lineage is incomplete, so trust erodes and rework grows.
- Reprocessing is risky and expensive without authoritative checkpoints.

How to escape the trap:

- Start at the source. Capture raw events from Kafka / CDC with offsets, partitions, schema identifiers, and event time.
- Write a Bronze table that preserves provenance fields intact, and treat it as append only.
- Use a durable checkpoint for ingestion jobs, and treat it as the journal of truth.
- Teach downstream models to read from Bronze or from a curated Silver built directly on Bronze.

Real data engineering begins one step earlier: at the raw ingestion layer. This is the Bronze layer.

## The Question

Ask yourself: “Am I truly aware of where the data I work on each day is deriving?”

- Event streams (clicks, payments, shipments)?
- Operational databases (CDC feeds)?
- Third‑party APIs (ads, SaaS, partners)?

If you only meet data once it’s already been transformed into tables, you’re blind to its origins.

## Why I Built Data Forge

[Data Forge](../../README.md) is a local, open‑source modern data stack you can run on a laptop: Spark, Trino, ClickHouse, Iceberg, Kafka, Airflow, MinIO, wired via Docker Compose. Resettable. No cloud bills.

The point isn’t “spin up tools.” It’s to practice flows: events moving through layers, orchestration that feels real, and patterns that make a data engineer more than just a SQL modeller.

One simple but powerful component is the data generator. It produces a live retail stream: orders, payments, shipments, customers, flowing into Kafka.

- Data Generator: [infra/data-generator/README.md](../../infra/data-generator/README.md)

This article shows why real data engineering starts at Bronze, and how Data Forge implements it.

## Medallion Logic

- Bronze: the uncut stone. Raw events with offsets, schema IDs, timestamps, payloads. Forensic truth.
- Silver: the refined ingot. Deduplicated, validated, enriched. Analyst‑friendly.
- Gold: the minted coin. Metrics/models for decisions.

Without Bronze, Silver is shaky; without Silver, Gold misleads.

---

## What Is Bronze (Practically)

A single Bronze row (teaching‑oriented JSON payload) might look like:

```
(event_source=orders.v1,
 partition=3,
 offset=12847,
 schema_id=17,
 event_time=2025-09-15 14:22:00,
 payload_size=512,
 json_payload='{...}')
```

Every field is provenance. Need to replay, reprocess, or debug? Bronze is your logbook.

### Why keep a copy of events in the lake

A reasonable question from a non technical stakeholder is: why duplicate events into the lake if they already exist in Kafka or in source systems. The short answer is reliability and independence for analytics.

- Durability beyond retention: Kafka is a conveyor belt with limited retention. The lake is long term storage for history.
- Replay and reproducibility: with a full event history plus checkpoints, you can rebuild tables, fix bugs, and audit decisions.
- Decoupling from producers: analytics does not depend on producer SLAs, outages, or schema churn. The lake isolates consumers from source instability.
- Governance and access control: one place to apply PII policies, masking, and lineage. Easier reviews and compliance.
- Cost and performance: scanning columnar tables and snapshots in the lake is cheaper and safer than hammering operational systems.
- Multi team enablement: new use cases can start from Bronze without touching producers or requesting new feeds.

In this repo, correctness is anchored by two mechanisms:

- Checkpoints: `--checkpoint` identifies the authoritative offset state for each run.
- ACID writes: Iceberg commits are atomic. Combined with offsets, this gives exactly once ingestion.

Storage is not unbounded. We compact, optimize, and expire snapshots as part of the DAG maintenance, so Bronze remains lean while keeping the facts that matter.

## Bounded Streaming Orchestration (Airflow + Spark Structured Streaming, availableNow trigger)

Engineers often ask: is Airflow for batch and Spark Streaming for streams, why combine them. availableNow is not a new technology. It is a trigger setting in Spark Structured Streaming that tells a streaming query to process all currently available data, advance state and watermarks as needed, commit, and then stop. It turns an infinite stream into a bounded catch up run.

In this pattern, Airflow owns the run lifecycle: scheduling, retries, observability. Spark owns streaming correctness: offsets, watermarks, exactly once writes. Combining them gives bounded streaming. Each run catches up and stops. The checkpoint carries continuity into the next run.

Note: availableNow is different from a plain batch job. The job is a streaming query with checkpoints and streaming semantics, but it terminates when caught up.

### How it works in this repo

- Airflow triggers a bounded Spark Structured Streaming job via `SparkSubmitOperator` with `trigger(availableNow=True)`.
- The job reads Kafka with `startingOffsets` and `maxOffsetsPerTrigger` to control how much to catch up.
- Offsets and streaming state live under the configured `checkpointLocation` (S3/MinIO).
- Writes land in Iceberg as atomic commits. On retry, Spark resumes from the last successful offset and Iceberg snapshot.

Key DAG params you can tweak at trigger time:

- `topics`: `orders.v1,payments.v1,shipments.v1,inventory-changes.v1,customer-interactions.v1`
- `checkpoint`: `s3a://checkpoints/spark/iceberg/bronze/raw_events` (durable; don’t delete casually)
- `starting_offsets`: `latest` (default) or `earliest` for backfills
- `batch_size`: maps to `maxOffsetsPerTrigger`
- `table`: `iceberg.bronze.raw_events`

### What you get

- Bounded runs with streaming semantics: each run consumes “what’s new,” commits, and stops.
- Offset‑driven correctness: Kafka offsets in checkpoints; Iceberg ACID snapshots on write.
- Late data handled predictably: watermarks/TTL carry across runs; no manual overlap windows.
- Stateful logic survives across runs: checkpoint persists state for joins/aggregations.
- Operational fit: backpressure via `batch_size`; simple retries; capacity scales per run.

### Replay and backfill

- Full rebuild: set `starting_offsets=earliest` and write to a fresh `checkpoint` path.
- Targeted catch‑up: run AvailableNow repeatedly until offsets/time range caught up; switch back to `latest`.
- Idempotency: offsets + Iceberg commits are authoritative; reruns won’t duplicate rows.

### Why it feels strange

- Airflow starts and stops the job, which looks like batch. The job itself is streaming and uses checkpoints and watermarks. Both are true at different layers.
- There is no always on cluster. Capacity is paid per run. The checkpoint carries continuity across runs.
- Recovery is by rerun. Offsets and Iceberg snapshots protect against duplicates and gaps.

### Why not just batch or always on

- Classic batch: you hand‑manage offsets, overlaps, and idempotency, which is fragile at scale.
- Always‑on streaming: ideal for sub‑second SLAs, but requires 24/7 resources and ops.
- AvailableNow: streaming correctness without 24/7 clusters, ideal for hourly Bronze ingestion.

### Common pitfalls

- Deleting checkpoints breaks replay guarantees. Version/rotate intentionally.
- Schema changes may require a new checkpoint path; plan migrations.
- Don’t bypass Iceberg (e.g., writing files directly) or you lose ACID lineage.

Orchestrating AvailableNow with Airflow hits a reliable, simple sweet spot for Bronze.

## Step 1: Boot the Playground

```bash
# Clone and configure
git clone https://github.com/fortiql/data-forge.git
cd data-forge && cp .env.example .env

# Start core services (MinIO, Trino, Spark, Kafka, etc.)
docker compose --profile core up -d

# Orchestration (Airflow)
docker compose --profile airflow up -d

# Live retail stream (Kafka + Postgres)
docker compose --profile datagen up -d
```

Now events flow: orders, payments, shipments, customer interactions.

- Quick start and ports: [README.md](../../README.md)
- Kafka topics and config: [infra/data-generator/README.md](../../infra/data-generator/README.md)

---

## Step 2: Orchestrate with Airflow

- Open Airflow: http://localhost:8085
- DAG: `bronze_events_kafka_stream`
- Path: [infra/airflow/dags/bronze_events_kafka_stream_dag.py](../../infra/airflow/dags/bronze_events_kafka_stream_dag.py)

Key pieces:

```python
with DAG(
    dag_id="bronze_events_kafka_stream",
    description="Manage Bronze raw_events via streaming from Kafka",
    params={
        "topics": ["orders.v1","payments.v1","shipments.v1","inventory-changes.v1","customer-interactions.v1"],
        "batch_size": 10000,
        "checkpoint": "s3a://checkpoints/spark/iceberg/bronze/raw_events",
        "starting_offsets": "latest",
        "table": "iceberg.bronze.raw_events",
        "expire_days": "7d",
    },
):
    bounded_ingest = SparkSubmitOperator(
        application="/opt/spark/jobs/bronze_events_kafka_stream.py",
        conf={
            "spark.sql.extensions": "org.apache.iceberg.spark.extensions.IcebergSparkSessionExtensions",
            "spark.sql.defaultCatalog": "iceberg",
            # ... S3/MinIO + Iceberg + Kafka
        },
        application_args=["--topics","{{ params.topics | join(',') }}",
                          "--batch-size","{{ params.batch_size }}",
                          "--checkpoint","{{ params.checkpoint }}",
                          "--starting-offsets","{{ params.starting_offsets }}",
                          "--table","{{ params.table }}"],
    )
```

After ingestion, the DAG runs Iceberg maintenance (OPTIMIZE, EXPIRE_SNAPSHOTS, REMOVE_ORPHANS) via Trino.

---

## Step 3: The Spark Job (AvailableNow)

Path: [infra/airflow/processing/spark/jobs/bronze_events_kafka_stream.py](../../infra/airflow/processing/spark/jobs/bronze_events_kafka_stream.py)

Read Kafka with AvailableNow, extract provenance, write exactly‑once to Iceberg:

```python
src = (
    spark.readStream.format("kafka")
    .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", kafka_bootstrap)
    .option("subscribe", topics)
    .option("startingOffsets", starting_offsets)
    .option("maxOffsetsPerTrigger", str(batch_size))
    .option("failOnDataLoss", "false")
    .load().withWatermark("timestamp", "1 minute")
)

ordered = src.select(
    F.col("topic").alias("event_source"),
    F.col("timestamp").alias("event_time"),
    F.col("partition"),
    F.col("offset"),
    F.col("value"),
).withColumn(
    "schema_id",
    F.when(F.length("value") >= 5,
           F.conv(F.hex(F.expr("substring(value, 2, 4)")), 16, 10).cast("int"))
     .otherwise(F.lit(None).cast("int"))
).withColumn(
    "payload_size",
    F.when(F.col("value").isNotNull(), F.length("value") - F.lit(5))
     .otherwise(F.lit(None))
).drop("value")

# Exactly-once to Iceberg with AvailableNow
(
  ordered.writeStream.format("iceberg")
  .option("path", table)
  .option("checkpointLocation", checkpoint)
  .outputMode("append")
  .trigger(availableNow=True)
  .start()
  .awaitTermination()
)
```

The checkpoint is the authoritative resume state. Delete it and you lose exactly-once resumption. To replay, use a fresh checkpoint and rebuild the table (or write to a new table) from earliest.

Production best practice vs demo note

- Production best practice: store a byte for byte copy of the Kafka value with provenance metadata (topic, partition, offset, schema_id, event_time). Avoid transforming or interpreting payloads at ingest time.
  - Reproducibility: enables reprocessing and rebuilding downstream layers if decoding bugs or schema changes occur.
  - Auditability: guarantees an exact, verifiable record of what was received.
  - Flexibility: allows future re decoding for analytics or ML with different decoders.
- Demo note: for learning and exploration, this repo exposes a `json_payload` column decoded from Avro so you can quickly inspect and query with tools like Trino or Superset.

---

## Step 4: Watch the Flow (Trino)

Connect any SQL client (e.g. DBeaver) to Trino (`http://localhost:8080`) and run:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM iceberg.bronze.raw_events
ORDER BY event_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

Each row ties back to a Kafka offset and partition.

---

## When Not to Use This Pattern

- <1s latency fraud detection
- High‑volume ad‑tech clickstreams (millions/sec)
- Always‑on pipelines where bounded catch‑up is unacceptable

For those: Flink, always‑on Spark, or a dedicated stream processor.

---

## Step 5: Train in Notebooks

Open JupyterLab (`docker compose --profile explore up -d`, then http://localhost:8888) and practice the katas:

- [Streaming Fundamentals: checkpoints, offsets, Avro wire format](../../notebooks/lessons/streaming/streaming-fundamentals-lesson.ipynb)
- [Multi-Topic Streaming: schema metadata, unified checkpoints](../../notebooks/lessons/streaming/multi-topic-streaming-lesson.ipynb)
- [Bronze on Iceberg: time travel, snapshot cleanup](../../notebooks/lessons/streaming/bronze-layer-iceberg-example.ipynb)

Repeat them until the motions feel natural.

---

## A Battle‑Scar Lesson

Imagine you’re running a Kafka → Spark batch ingestion job. Offsets aren’t in checkpoints; they’re tracked in a fragile side table — or worse, not tracked at all.

Your Airflow DAG is set with 0 retries to “avoid duplicates.” Someone clicks Clear Task in the UI. Spark reruns, rereads the same offsets, and inserts hundreds of millions of rows again. Days are lost untangling the mess.

**Offsets belong in checkpoints, not spreadsheets.** With AvailableNow, reruns and retries are safe. Spark resumes exactly where it left off, and Bronze stays clean.

---

## Operational Discipline

- Checkpoints are sacred. Version them. Don’t casually delete.
- Maintenance is daily kata. Run OPTIMIZE and EXPIRE SNAPSHOTS.
- Observability is armor. Emit metrics: offsets caught, rows written, batch duration.

## Cleanup After Experiments

When you are done experimenting, avoid accidental double-appends by resetting the generator, table, and checkpoint.

- Stop the data generator

```bash
docker compose stop data-generator
```

- Drop the Bronze table (so a replay does not append on top)

Run in any Trino client:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS iceberg.bronze.raw_events;
```

- Remove the checkpoint prefix in MinIO

Use MinIO Console at http://localhost:9001 and delete:

```
checkpoints/spark/iceberg/bronze/raw_events/
```
